# ðŸ’¸ Dummy Token Transfer

Demo program for implementing a token transfer that can delegate and execute both on-chain and in the ephemeral rollup.

## Running Tests on Devnet

To run tests on the devnet, use the following command:

```bash
anchor test --skip-local-validator --skip-build --skip-deploy
```

## Running Tests on Devnet with a Local Ephemeral Rollup

To run tests using a local ephemeral validator, follow these steps:

### 1. Install the Local Validator

Ensure you have the ephemeral validator installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g @magicblock-labs/ephemeral-validator
```

### 2. Start the Local Validator

Run the local validator with the appropriate environment variables:

```bash
ACCOUNTS_REMOTE=https://rpc.magicblock.app/devnet ACCOUNTS_LIFECYCLE=ephemeral ephemeral-validator
```

`ACCOUNTS_REMOTE` point to the reference RPC endpoint, and `ACCOUNTS_LIFECYCLE` should be set to `ephemeral`.

### 3. Run the Tests with the Local Validator

Execute the tests while pointing to the local validator:

```bash
PROVIDER_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8899 WS_ENDPOINT=ws://localhost:8900 anchor test --skip-build --skip-deploy --skip-local-validator
```

This setup ensures tests run efficiently on a local ephemeral rollup while connecting to the devnet.
